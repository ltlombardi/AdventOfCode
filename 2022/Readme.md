My design principle were:
- Every puzzle solution must be auto-contained in it's file / class.
- Input reading could have been moved to a central location, but each puzzle can take advantage of different file reading.
- Some puzzles have more than one solution that I found interesting.
- I improved performance only when easy to implement.

This runs on VSCode. 
On VS the folder Paths don't work, and it tries to create a sln file
